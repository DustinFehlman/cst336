                <p>"Computers have a central and growing role in commerce, industry, government, medicine, education, entertainment and society at large. Software engineers are those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis,
                    specification, design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of software systems. Because of their roles in developing software systems, software engineers have significant opportunities to do good or cause harm, to enable
                    others to do good or cause harm, or to influence others to do good or cause harm." - <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics">Copyright Â© 1999 by the

                    The increasing dependence on computers for critical infrastructures essential for the functioning of a society and its economy has given rise to host of ethical, social, and legal issues. The ability to make sound ethical decisions is thus an important
                    part of Computing and Software engineer's professional skills.</p>
